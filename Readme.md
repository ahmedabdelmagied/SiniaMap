Geocode and Route
=======================
This app uses a local data to demonstrate an offline workflow. A mobile map package is used to display a map with operational data, and perform geocoding and routing. A tile cache is also used to display a basemap.

This was used in the 'ArcGIS Runtime SDKs: Working with apps online and offline' technical session at the Esri Developer Summit Europe, December 2016.
